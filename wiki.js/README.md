NOTES

# Install
Run "make" and enter "localhost" in for the URL.

# Opinions

This is a nice effort, but not at all close to Confluence.

ISSUE #1:

Same issues as MS-Teams:
- No persistent links.
  So, refactoring your page causes links to it to break.

- Links to pages, not to sections of pages
  No way to use this to link to say, a single term in the middle of a glossary page.

ISSUE #2:
GUI is not as user-friendly as Confluence.
